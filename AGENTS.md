# HlaRNASeq AI-Agent Instructions

This file is the single source of truth for how agents must work in this repository.

## Project Overview

You are helping develop
**nf-core/hlarnaseq** -- a bioinformatics pipeline that
precisely quantifies human HLA gene expression from RNA-seq data
by using personalized reference genomes.

## Technology Stack (fixed)

- Nextflow for workflow execution
- Python and R for data analysis
- Every runtime tool dependency is declared by the process that uses it, following
  the nf-core module convention: an `environment.yml` feeding a `conda` directive,
  paired with a matching pinned `container` directive. Nextflow resolves them under
  `-profile conda`, `docker`, `singularity` or `apptainer`.
- Follow NF-Core template and guidelines
- Use existing NF-Core modules when possible

Do not introduce alternative frameworks and technologies.
Docker and Singularity/Apptainer container creation and execution are permitted;
always derive both the `conda` and `container` directives from one
`environment.yml`.

**No pipeline step may depend on tools from the environment Nextflow was launched
in.** That reproducibility bar is already met — every process under
`modules/local/` and `modules/nf-core/` declares both directives — so treat it as
an invariant to preserve, not a goal to work toward:

- do not add a process without both a `conda` and a `container` directive;
- never resolve a tool from `$PATH`, `conda run -n <env>`, an interpreter assumed
  to exist on the host, or any operator-prepared environment;
- the only environment an operator prepares is the one used to _launch_ the
  pipeline (`nextflow`, `nf-core`, `nf-test`) and to run `testdata-make/`;
  nothing inside the pipeline may rely on it.

Large out-of-band **reference data** inputs (`--hlala_graph_dir`,
`--arcashla_reference_dir`, `--hibag_model`, `--hlapm_repo`) are a separate,
deliberate exception: they are data, not tools, and each has a helper script
under `scripts/` that builds it inside the same pinned image the pipeline runs.

## Development Model

Work one small, reviewable iteration at a time.

1. Plan the change and save the proposed plan to `artifacts/1_plan.md`.
2. Stop for human approval before implementation.
3. After approval, implement only the approved scope.
4. Save implementation notes to `artifacts/2_implement.md`.
5. Validate the change and save results to `artifacts/3_validate.md`.
6. Stop for human review. The human reviews and commits.

Do not commit changes to Git.

If `artifacts/` does not exist, AI agents must create it before writing
required reports or validation outputs.

## AI Configuration Maintenance

Changes limited to `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/**`, or `artifacts/ai-*.md`
may be handled as AI-configuration maintenance rather than pipeline
implementation.

For AI-configuration maintenance:

- do not change pipeline behavior;
- preserve the no-commit rule;
- write review or change notes to an `artifacts/ai-*.md` file when useful;
- use the full plan, approval, implementation, and validation cycle when the
  change affects pipeline code, tests, runtime behavior, parameters, outputs,
  dependencies, or user-facing pipeline docs.

## Repository Conventions

- Preserve nf-core template structure and naming conventions.
- Prefer nf-core/modules and nf-core/subworkflows over local custom code when a suitable maintained component exists.
- Keep workflow logic in Nextflow DSL2.
- Keep custom analysis scripts in Python or R under `bin/`, regardless of
  whether a module runs via Conda or a container — `bin/` scripts are staged
  onto `PATH` in both cases.
- Everything a process needs — including the interpreters its `bin/` script runs
  under — comes from that process's own `conda`/`container` declaration. Never
  from the launching environment.
- Docker, Singularity, and Apptainer container creation, building, pulling,
  and running are permitted. Use the standard nf-core module pattern:
  declare dependencies once in an `environment.yml`, feed it to the
  `conda` directive, and pair it with a matching `container` directive
  (a pinned Biocontainers/Wave image, or a module-local `Dockerfile` when
  the tool is not on Bioconda).
- Prefer a module-local `${moduleDir}/environment.yml`. The one shared
  exception is `containers/datatools/`, for modules that run this repository's
  own small `bin/` scripts over the same interpreters rather than a tool of
  their own; see `containers/datatools/README.md` before adding to it.
- Every runtime tool dependency must be pinned and documented in the
  `environment.yml` that declares it, and its version reported in `versions.yml`.
- If a module needs a tool it does not declare, add it to that module's
  `environment.yml` and rebuild/repin its container — do not ask the developer to
  install it into their environment. Only ask when a _launcher_ tool
  (`nextflow`, `nf-core`, `nf-test`) or a container runtime is missing.
- Keep test data small and suitable for nf-core test profiles.
- Update `nextflow_schema.json`, docs, tests, and pipeline metadata together when parameters, inputs, or outputs change.
- Preserve parameter validation through nf-schema.

## Pipeline Quality Bar

For pipeline behavior changes, agents must consider:

- channel contracts between workflows, subworkflows, and modules;
- sample sheet schema and validation;
- test profile behavior;
- nf-test coverage or snapshot updates;
- `docs/usage.md`, `docs/output.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and citations when user-facing behavior changes;
- whether a matching nf-core module already exists;
- that every process still declares both a `conda` and a `container` directive,
  with pinned versions and matching `versions.yml` reporting.

## Validation Expectations

Use the smallest validation set that proves the iteration.

Before running validation, agents must verify the **launcher** tools are
available. These are the only tools an agent ever expects from an environment
rather than from a module's own declaration:

- run `command -v nextflow`, `command -v nf-test`, and `command -v nf-core`;
- if any is unavailable, put the launcher environment on `PATH` for the
  command, for example:
  `export PATH="$HOME/miniforge3/envs/nf-core/bin:$PATH"; .agents/skills/validate-hlarnaseq/scripts/validate.sh`;
- if they are still unavailable, stop and ask the user to fix the launcher
  environment.

Never "fix" a missing _pipeline_ tool this way. A `command not found` from
inside a task means that module's `environment.yml`/`container` is wrong or a
container profile was not used — never a reason to install something on the
host or to fall back to the launcher environment.

Container validation is enabled:

- run `docker info` (and `singularity --version` / `apptainer --version` when
  targeting Singularity/Apptainer) to confirm the container runtime is
  available before relying on containerized profiles;
- containerized `nextflow run` profiles (`docker`, `singularity`, `apptainer`)
  may be created and run as part of validation;
- if a container runtime or a specific image is genuinely unavailable
  (missing daemon, no network/registry access), record that explicitly in
  `artifacts/3_validate.md` as a blocked check with residual risk.

When the validation script needs network access or access to tool caches outside
the sandbox, agents must run it with escalated privileges.
In Codex this means calling the shell command with
`sandbox_permissions="require_escalated"` and a justification such as:

> Do you want to allow validation to access network, container registries, and
> local tool caches?

When escalation is required and the launcher environment must be on `PATH`, use
this command shape:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/miniforge3/envs/nf-core/bin:$PATH"; .agents/skills/validate-hlarnaseq/scripts/validate.sh
```

Preferred checks, when available:

- `nf-core pipelines lint`
- `nf-test test`
- `nextflow run . -profile test --outdir <OUTDIR>`
- `nextflow run . -profile debug,test --outdir <OUTDIR>`
- `nextflow run . -profile docker,test --outdir <OUTDIR>`
- `nextflow run . -profile singularity,test --outdir <OUTDIR>`
- `pre-commit run --all-files`

If a check is unavailable or blocked by missing tools, network, or test data,
record that explicitly in `artifacts/3_validate.md` with the command attempted
and the residual risk.

Validation scripts should write logs and Nextflow output directories under a
unique `artifacts/validation/<timestamp>/` directory so repeated validation
runs do not overwrite earlier evidence.

## Human-in-the-loop Rules

- Ask clarifying questions only when a reasonable assumption would risk wrong pipeline behavior or wasted implementation.
- Default behavior for every pipeline change is the full plan → approve → implement → validate cycle described above. This is the default for any request to add, fix, change, or refactor pipeline behavior, even if the human does not mention "plan" explicitly.
- For implementation requests without an approved plan, produce the plan first and wait.
- Explicit approval means the human says the current `artifacts/1_plan.md` is approved, for example: "approved", "approve the plan", or "implement this plan".
- `artifacts/2_implement.md` must quote or summarize the approval message with date/time when available.
- Keep each iteration small enough for practical review.
- Never hide skipped validation.
- Do not rewrite unrelated scaffold files merely to satisfy style preferences.

### Bypassing the plan/approve cycle

- The plan → approve → implement → validate cycle may be skipped only when the human explicitly instructs a direct change in the same request, using clear language such as "make this change directly", "skip the plan", "just implement it, no plan needed", or "don't stop for approval". A generic sense of urgency or a short task description is not sufficient — the instruction to bypass must be explicit and about process, not just about scope.
- When bypassing is explicitly requested:
  - still keep the change small and reviewable, and still avoid unrelated refactors or new frameworks;
  - still run validation appropriate to the change and report results (validation itself is not optional, only the pre-implementation plan/approval stop is skipped);
  - still do not commit to Git unless separately asked;
  - state in the response that the plan/approval step was skipped because the human asked for a direct change, so the bypass is visible and auditable.
- If a bypass instruction is ambiguous (e.g., unclear whether it covers approval, validation, or both), ask a single clarifying question rather than assuming the broadest possible skip.
- AI-configuration-only changes (`AGENTS.md`, `.agents/**`, `.claude/**`, `artifacts/ai-*.md`) already skip the pipeline plan/approve/implement/validate cycle by default per "AI Configuration Maintenance" above; that is a separate, standing exception and does not require the human to say anything extra.
