## Introduction

**HLARNASeq** is a bioinformatics pipeline that
precisely qualifies human HLA genes expression from RNASeq data
by using personalized reference genomes.

The pipeline can use results of [NF-Core RNASeq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/latest) pipeline as input.

### Pipeline scheme

<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/guidelines/graphic_design/workflow_diagrams#examples for examples.   -->

- Extract MHC region and unmapped reads from RNASeq data
- Validate the extracted paired FASTQ files before arcasHLA analysis
- Call HLA reference alleles from RNASeq data
- (Optional) Call HLA reference alleles from WGS/WES data
  - Call HLA allele consensus on RNASeq and WGS/WES data
- Map RNASeq data to personalized references
- Extract HLA genes counts
- Hijack original count matrix

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

Provide an RNA samplesheet with the exact columns `rna_id,bam,bai,unpaired_r1,unpaired_r2`. The requested HLA region is passed to samtools unchanged, so its chromosome notation must match the BAM headers.

```bash
nextflow run wtsi-hgi/hlarnaseq \
   --rna_samples rna_samples.csv \
   --hla_region chr6:28500000-33400000 \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option.
> Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option
> can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/hlarnaseq/usage)
and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/hlarnaseq/parameters).
