## Introduction

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add documentation about anything specific to running your pipeline. For general topics, please point to (and add to) the main nf-core website. -->

## RNA samplesheet input

Provide the required RNA manifest with `--rna_samples` and the region to extract with `--hla_region`:

```bash
--rna_samples '[path to RNA samplesheet]' \
--hla_region 'chr6:28500000-33400000'
```

The CSV header must exactly match the following five columns:

```csv title="rna_samples.csv"
rna_id,bam,bai,unpaired_r1,unpaired_r2
RNA_SAMPLE_1,/path/to/RNA_SAMPLE_1.bam,/path/to/RNA_SAMPLE_1.bam.bai,/path/to/RNA_SAMPLE_1.unpaired_1.fastq.gz,/path/to/RNA_SAMPLE_1.unpaired_2.fastq.gz
```

| Column        | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rna_id`      | Unique RNA sample identifier without spaces.                                                          |
| `bam`         | Coordinate-sorted RNA-seq BAM containing aligned reads; must end in `.bam`.                           |
| `bai`         | Index for `bam`; must end in `.bai`.                                                                  |
| `unpaired_r1` | Gzip-compressed read-1 FASTQ to combine with BAM-derived MHC reads; must end in `.fq.gz`/`.fastq.gz`. |
| `unpaired_r2` | Gzip-compressed read-2 FASTQ to combine with BAM-derived MHC reads; must end in `.fq.gz`/`.fastq.gz`. |

All columns are mandatory and each `rna_id` may occur only once. Relative file paths are resolved from the samplesheet directory, launch directory, or pipeline project directory. The extraction is paired-end only.

`--hla_region` is passed unchanged to samtools. The user must choose coordinates and chromosome notation that match every BAM header: the pipeline does not translate `6` to `chr6`, or vice versa.

For each sample, the pipeline extracts complete pairs overlapping this region, excludes secondary and supplementary alignments, and combines the recovered mates with the supplied FASTQs. An [example RNA samplesheet](../assets/rna_samples.csv) is included.

Each extracted read pair is checked with [validatefastq](https://github.com/biopet/validatefastq) before it is made available to downstream arcasHLA steps. A non-zero validator exit status or a reported `ERROR` stops the pipeline; the pipeline does not attempt to repair, reorder, or skip invalid pairs. Successful per-sample validation logs are written beneath `arcashla/validation/`.

`ARCASHLA_VALIDATE_FASTQ` provisions the validator itself, via its own module `environment.yml`/`conda` directive (`bioconda::biopet-validatefastq=0.1.1`) paired with the matching pinned Biocontainers image, resolved automatically under `-profile conda`/`docker`/`singularity`/`apptainer`. Nothing needs to be installed by hand, and no operator-prepared Conda environment is used for this step. Note that the packaged executable is named `biopet-validatefastq` (there is no plain `validatefastq` alias); running the pipeline with no container/Conda profile at all leaves the module unprovisioned and it will fail fast saying so.

Once a sample's extracted reads pass validation, the pipeline runs `arcasHLA genotype` on them, requesting the genes listed in `--arcashla_genes` (a broad default gene list is provided). Per-sample results are written to `arcashla/genotype/<rna_id>.genotype.json` (+ `.log`).

### arcasHLA genotyping environment

`ARCASHLA_GENOTYPE` provisions arcasHLA itself via its own module `environment.yml`/`conda` directive (`arcas-hla=0.6.0`, `kallisto=0.44.0` - later kallisto versions are incompatible with this arcasHLA version's `kallisto pseudo` output parsing), resolved automatically by Nextflow under `-profile conda`. No separate operator-prepared Conda environment is needed for this step.

arcasHLA has no option to point `genotype` at an external reference database at runtime; the reference used is always whichever one exists inside its own install. Rather than have the pipeline build this reference itself (it clones the ~4GB [ANHIG/IMGTHLA](https://github.com/ANHIG/IMGTHLA) database - too slow and network-dependent to do inside every container build or as a first-task surprise), it is prepared once, out of band, and pointed to with a required **`--arcashla_reference_dir`** parameter - the same pattern as `--hlala_graph_dir` for HLA-LA above. `ARCASHLA_GENOTYPE` takes the directory as a staged process input and symlinks it into place as its own `dat/ref` at the start of every task; the symlink swap is fast and atomic, so it's redone unconditionally on every task with no locking or "first use" logic.

Because the reference is a real process input rather than a path pasted into the task script, Nextflow resolves it and hands it to the container engine itself (`singularity.autoMounts`, or a Docker volume). It can therefore live on **any filesystem the executor can read** - including behind a symlink onto a separate mount - with no `SINGULARITY_BIND`, no `singularity.runOptions`, and no bind flags of your own. The pipeline also checks at launch that the directory actually contains a built reference (`hla.idx` and `hla.p.json`) rather than merely existing, so a half-finished build fails immediately with a clear message instead of surfacing later as an arcasHLA `FileNotFoundError` on `dat/ref/hla.p.json`.

Build the reference once with:

```bash
scripts/build_image_arcashla.sh              # build the container image, once
scripts/build_arcashla_reference.sh /path/to/arcashla_reference   # build the reference into it, once
```

`build_arcashla_reference.sh` runs inside the same container image the pipeline itself uses (so the reference matches the exact pinned `arcas-hla=0.6.0`/`kallisto=0.44.0` versions). It does not just run plain `arcasHLA reference`: as of IMGT/HLA's Release 3.56.0, its large files (including the `hla.dat` this arcasHLA version expects as a plain file) are distributed as separate `.zip` downloads rather than checked into git, which arcasHLA 0.6.0 doesn't know how to handle. Instead, the script clones IMGT/HLA itself and checks out a pinned pre-3.56.0 commit (**IMGT/HLA version 3.52.0** by default, tag `v3.52.0-alpha`, pinned by commit SHA; override with `IMGTHLA_COMMIT`), then runs `arcasHLA reference --rebuild` against that pinned checkout. This also pins the exact HLA database version used, rather than depending on whatever the upstream default branch contains when the script happens to be run. It checks that a real `hla.idx` file was actually produced before finishing (arcasHLA can otherwise fail partway without a clear error).

Version 3.52.0 is the default because it is the IPD-IMGT/HLA version HLApm uses, so arcasHLA's genotype calls and the personalized reference HLApm builds from them share one allele nomenclature. It is not reachable via `arcasHLA reference --version`, whose built-in version-to-commit mapping stops at 3.46.0 - checking the commit out directly, as this script does, is what makes any pre-3.56.0 version available. **If you built a reference with an earlier version of this script, which defaulted to 3.46.0, re-run it to pick up 3.52.0**: the pipeline does not inspect or validate the database version of the directory you pass to `--arcashla_reference_dir`.

Then run the pipeline with:

```bash
--arcashla_reference_dir /path/to/arcashla_reference
```

The build needs roughly **15 GB of free space** and network access to `github.com`. It runs under Docker if that image is loaded, otherwise Singularity/Apptainer against the local `.sif`; `RUNTIME=docker|singularity|apptainer` forces one. Under Singularity/Apptainer all of that space is used on the output directory's own filesystem - a `.sif` is read-only at execution time, so the IMGT/HLA checkout cannot live inside the image the way it does in a Docker container's writable layer, and the script instead mounts a writable scratch directory over the image's arcasHLA `dat/` directory. That scratch directory defaults to a temporary `<output-dir>.build.XXXXXX` sibling, removed when the script exits; set `DAT_WORK_DIR` to put it on a different (larger) filesystem, in which case it is left in place. The free-space check runs before the download and can be adjusted with `REQUIRED_GB`. See `scripts/build_arcashla_reference.sh --help` for all override variables.

Under `-profile docker`/`-profile singularity`/`-profile apptainer`, `ARCASHLA_GENOTYPE` uses a container image built from `modules/local/arcashla/genotype/Dockerfile` (just the pinned packages - no reference baked in, for the same reason it isn't built automatically above). Build it once before running with a container profile:

```bash
scripts/build_image_arcashla.sh
```

This builds and tags the Docker image as `quay.io/hlarnaseq/arcashla-genotype:0.6.0`, matching `nextflow.config`'s `docker.registry`/`singularity.registry = 'quay.io'` default so `-profile docker` finds it locally with no registry push needed. It also converts that same image into a local `modules/local/arcashla/genotype/arcashla-genotype.sif` (when `singularity`/`apptainer` is available) for `-profile singularity`/`apptainer`: Singularity/Apptainer has no access to Docker's local image store, and a bare image name is not a filesystem path, so without this `.sif` file Nextflow would otherwise try (and fail) to pull the image from `quay.io` over the network. See `scripts/build_image_arcashla.sh --help` for details and override variables.

## WGS samplesheet input

Optionally provide WGS BAM inputs with `--wgs_samples`:

```bash
--wgs_samples '[path to WGS samplesheet file]'
```

The WGS samplesheet must be a comma-separated file with exactly these columns:

```csv title="wgs_samples.csv"
WGS_sample_id,WGS_BAM_path,WGS_BAI_path
NA12878,testdata-make/hlarnases-testdata/wgs/NA12878.chr6_hla.GRCh38.bam,testdata-make/hlarnases-testdata/wgs/NA12878.chr6_hla.GRCh38.bam.bai
```

| Column          | Description                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WGS_sample_id` | WGS sample identifier. This entry is mandatory and cannot contain spaces.                                            |
| `WGS_BAM_path`  | Path to the WGS BAM file. This entry is mandatory and must end in `.bam`.                                            |
| `WGS_BAI_path`  | Path to the WGS BAI index. This entry is mandatory and must be named `<BAM file name>.bai` (i.e. end in `.bam.bai`). |

Each row is validated and loaded as a separate WGS sample channel entry. Relative BAM and BAI paths are resolved from the directory containing the WGS samplesheet, the launch directory, or the pipeline project directory. An [example WGS samplesheet](../assets/wgs_samples.csv) has been provided with the pipeline.

The index must be named exactly `<BAM file name>.bai` (for example `NA12878.bam` + `NA12878.bam.bai`), not `<BAM base name>.bai`: HLA-LA resolves a BAM's index by appending `.bai` to the BAM path, and will not find an index named otherwise. This is enforced by [`assets/schema_wgs_samples.json`](../assets/schema_wgs_samples.json), so a mismatch fails at samplesheet validation rather than deep inside HLA-LA.

When `--wgs_samples` is provided, the pipeline runs HLA-LA once per WGS BAM and combines the reported G-group allele calls into `hlala/HLA-LA_combined.tsv`.
HLA-LA itself (and the samtools/bwa/picard tooling it shells out to) is provisioned by the `HLALA_TYPING` module's own `environment.yml`/`conda` directive and matching pinned `container` (`hla-la=1.0.4`), resolved automatically by Nextflow under `-profile conda`/`docker`/`singularity`/`apptainer`. No separate operator-prepared Conda environment is needed for this step.

The prepared HLA-LA **graph**, however, remains a required, separately-prepared input: the pipeline never downloads, builds, or packages HLA-LA graph data (the `hlala/preparegraph` step is deliberately not wired in), the same pattern as `--arcashla_reference_dir` for arcasHLA above.
Provide the **parent** directory containing the prepared graph with `--hlala_graph_dir`, and the **graph directory's own name** with `--hlala_graph` (defaults to `PRG_MHC_GRCh38_withIMGT`) - i.e. the graph the pipeline uses is `<hlala_graph_dir>/<hlala_graph>`.

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/hlarnaseq \
    --rna_samples ./rna_samples.csv \
    --hla_region chr6:28500000-33400000 \
    --wgs_samples ./wgs_samples.csv \
    --hlala_graph_dir /path/to/HLA-LA/graphs \
    --outdir ./results
```

### Preparing the HLA-LA graph

Prepare the graph once, out of band, with:

```bash
scripts/build_reference_hlala.sh /path/to/HLA-LA/graphs
```

This downloads the published PRG graph package (`PRG_MHC_GRCh38_withIMGT`, ~2.25 GB), verifies its md5, extracts it, and then indexes it twice over, inside the same pinned `hla-la:1.0.4` container image `HLALA_TYPING` itself runs - so the graph is indexed by the exact build that will later consume it:

1. `HLA-LA --action prepareGraph`, which produces `serializedGRAPH`; and
2. `bwa index` over `extendedReferenceGenome/extendedReferenceGenome.fa`.

Unlike arcasHLA's image, this one is public (Biocontainers/Galaxy depot), so there is no companion image-build script: the container is pulled on first use. Docker is used when its daemon is reachable, otherwise Singularity/Apptainer. That image already ships the `bwa` step 2 needs, so nothing extra has to be installed.

**Step 2 is not optional, even though `prepareGraph` does not do it.** The published tarball ships `mapping_PRGonly/referenceGenome.fa` pre-indexed but `extendedReferenceGenome/` with the FASTA alone, and HLA-LA copes by building that bwa index lazily, the first time it maps reads against the extended reference genome - writing it back into the graph directory, next to the FASTA. The pipeline hands `HLALA_TYPING` one shared graph directory for every WGS sample, so with an unindexed graph all the concurrent per-sample tasks find the index missing, all launch the same `bwa index` against the same paths, and they overwrite each other's partial output: all but (at most) one sample fails, hours into the run. Building the index once, up front, removes the race. The pipeline also refuses to start a `--wgs_samples` run against a graph that lacks it, naming this script in the error, rather than letting the race happen.

Budget for it before starting:

- **~29 GB on disk** for the extracted and fully indexed graph (`serializedGRAPH` alone is ~5.5 GB, and the bwa index adds ~5.1 GB on top of the 3 GB extended reference FASTA), plus the 2.25 GB tarball. The script checks free space on the target filesystem up front (override the floor with `REQUIRED_GB`) rather than failing hours in.
- **A few hours** for `prepareGraph`, and per HLA-LA's own README it "might take up to 40G of memory". The script warns if the machine has less than 40 GB of RAM but still proceeds. `bwa index` adds roughly another hour and is not memory-hungry.

Re-running the script is free: if the graph is already fully indexed - `<output-dir>/<graph>/serializedGRAPH` non-empty **and** the extended reference FASTA's `.sa`/`.ann`/`.bwt` all present - it reports the graph as already built and exits without downloading, extracting, or indexing anything, and that check runs _before_ the download.

Each indexing step is skipped independently when its own output is already in place, so **a graph prepared before this pipeline built the bwa index is repaired by simply re-running the script on the same directory**: it adds the missing index and neither re-downloads the package nor re-runs the multi-hour `prepareGraph`. An interrupted run that already extracted the package likewise resumes at indexing instead of re-downloading.

**To force a full rebuild, delete the graph directory and re-run**; that is deliberately the only supported way, so there is no "force" flag that could half-overwrite an existing graph. `GRAPH_NAME`, `GRAPH_URL`, `GRAPH_MD5`, `TARBALL` (use an already-downloaded copy), `IMAGE_TAG`, `SIF_PATH`, and `REQUIRED_GB` are all overridable - see `scripts/build_reference_hlala.sh --help`.

On success the script prints the exact parameters to pass:

```bash
--hlala_graph_dir /path/to/HLA-LA/graphs --hlala_graph PRG_MHC_GRCh38_withIMGT
```

**Limitation: the script fetches and indexes a _published_ graph; it cannot construct one from scratch.** This is not an unfinished feature - building a PRG graph for a newer IMGT/HLA release or for custom loci is not scriptable outside the tool author's own environment. HLA-LA's own `src/Update graphs.txt` documents that workflow as Perl scripts run on the author's Windows laptop, plus the separate older MHC-PRG v1 binary (not shipped in the bioconda `hla-la` package), hardcoded cluster paths, and input files that were never distributed. A newer graph is an upstream request to the HLA-LA authors. The `GRAPH_NAME`/`GRAPH_URL`/`GRAPH_MD5` overrides exist so other _published_ graph packages, an offline mirror, or a future move of the download host work without editing the script.

### Requirement: `--outdir` and the Nextflow work directory must share a filesystem

**When `--wgs_samples` is used, `--outdir` and the Nextflow work directory (`-w`, default `./work`) must be on the same filesystem.** This is a hard requirement, not a recommendation.

HLA-LA's per-sample output directory is published with `mode: 'link'` (hard links) rather than the pipeline's usual `copy` - see the `HLALA_TYPING` entry in `conf/modules.config`. The `HLALA_TYPING` module declares its per-sample output directory as an output alongside individual files inside it, which makes publishing all-or-nothing (Nextflow offers only the directory to `publishDir`, never the nested paths), and publishing everything by copy would duplicate HLA-LA's multi-gigabyte intermediates (`extraction*.bam`, `remapped_with_a.bam`, `R_{1,2,U}.fastq`) for every WGS sample. Hard links make that free.

Hard links cannot cross filesystems, and **Nextflow does not fall back to copying**: if `--outdir` is on a different filesystem than the work directory, the run aborts with

```
Failed to publish file: /path/to/work/xx/xxxxxx/<sample_id>; to: /path/to/outdir/hlala/<sample_id> [link]
```

This is easy to hit on HPC, where the normal layout is `--outdir` on shared/project storage and `-w` on fast local scratch. Either put both on the same filesystem, or override the publishing mode in a custom config passed with `-c`:

```groovy title="hlala_copy.config"
process {
    withName: 'HLALA_TYPING' {
        publishDir = [
            path: { "${params.outdir}/hlala" },
            mode: 'copy'
        ]
    }
}
```

Be aware that this reintroduces the multi-gigabyte-per-sample duplication that `'link'` exists to avoid. `'symlink'`/`'rellink'` are cheaper alternatives, but the published results then break as soon as the work directory is cleaned.

## SNP-array samplesheet input (HIBAG)

HIBAG is the alternative to HLA-LA for the genotype-side HLA calls. Instead of typing HLA from WGS alignments, it _imputes_ HLA alleles from GWAS SNP genotypes, so its input is microarray data in PLINK binary format:

```bash
--array_samples '[path to SNP-array samplesheet file]' --hibag_model '[path to a pre-fit HIBAG model .RData]'
```

**`--array_samples` and `--wgs_samples` are mutually exclusive.** Both fill the same genotype-side input to the consensus step, so the pipeline fails fast if given both rather than silently picking one.

The SNP-array samplesheet must be a comma-separated file with exactly these columns:

```csv title="array_samples.csv"
array_sample_id,array_bed_path,array_bim_path,array_fam_path
NA12878_omniexpress,testdata-make/hlarnases-testdata/array/NA12878.omniexpress.xMHC.hg19.bed,testdata-make/hlarnases-testdata/array/NA12878.omniexpress.xMHC.hg19.bim,testdata-make/hlarnases-testdata/array/NA12878.omniexpress.xMHC.hg19.fam
```

| Column            | Description                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `array_sample_id` | Label for the PLINK **dataset**. Mandatory, cannot contain spaces. See the warning below. |
| `array_bed_path`  | Path to the PLINK `.bed` genotype file. Mandatory, must end in `.bed`.                    |
| `array_bim_path`  | Path to the matching `.bim` variant file. Mandatory, must end in `.bim`.                  |
| `array_fam_path`  | Path to the matching `.fam` sample file. Mandatory, must end in `.fam`.                   |

Relative paths are resolved from the directory containing the samplesheet, the launch directory, or the pipeline project directory, as for the other samplesheets. An [example SNP-array samplesheet](../assets/array_samples.csv) is provided with the pipeline.

### :warning: A row is one PLINK dataset, not one sample

This is the one place where the SNP-array samplesheet behaves differently from the RNA and WGS ones. A PLINK fileset can hold many samples, and HIBAG imputes all of them in a single call, so:

- `array_sample_id` is only a **label** for the dataset. It is used for task tags and output filenames, and nothing else.
- The sample IDs that reach the consensus step come from the **IID column of the `.fam` file**.

It is therefore the `.fam` IIDs - not `array_sample_id` - that must match the `wgs_sample_id` values in `--sample_key`. If they do not match, the affected individuals simply produce no consensus rows rather than raising an error, so check this first if consensus output looks empty.

### The HIBAG model

`--hibag_model` is **mandatory** whenever `--array_samples` is given, and the pipeline fails fast if it is missing or does not exist.

The file must be an `.RData` holding either a single `hlaAttrBagObj` or a named list of them, one per HLA locus - the shape the published HIBAG per-platform models use. Pick a model built for your array platform and genome assembly; the pipeline never trains one. By default every locus in the model file is predicted; restrict that with `--hibag_loci 'A,B,C'`.

Set `--hibag_assembly` (`hg18`/`hg19`/`hg38`, default `hg19`) to the assembly of your **genotypes**, and make sure the model was built on the same one.

### :warning: If HIBAG reports that no SNPs match

The most common failure is a model whose SNP coordinates do not line up with your array manifest. HIBAG's own error for this is a bare `There is no overlapping of SNPs!`, so the pipeline checks the overlap first and fails with something you can act on:

```text
HLA-A: none of the model's 266 SNPs match the array data under --match-type 'RefSNP+Position'.
    SNPs found under each criterion:
      Position         0 of 266 model SNPs
      Pos+Allele       0 of 266 model SNPs
      RefSNP+Position  0 of 266 model SNPs
      RefSNP           264 of 266 model SNPs
    Try --match-type with one of: RefSNP.
```

Set `--hibag_match_type` to whichever criterion the message says will work. The default is the strict `RefSNP+Position`, which is correct when the model and the genotypes were built against the same manifest and assembly. `RefSNP` matches on rsID alone and is the usual fix for a coordinate offset. If _no_ criterion matches anything, the model and the data are on different assemblies, or the array does not cover the xMHC.

`--hibag_min_prob` (default `0`, i.e. no filtering) drops calls whose posterior probability falls below the threshold. The default matches the HLA-LA path, which applies no confidence filter either.

### :warning: Partial SNP overlap is rejected, not warned about

HIBAG does **not** fail when only some of a model's SNPs are found. It returns confident-looking alleles computed from whatever matched, and they can simply be wrong. Observed against a published model whose rsIDs had gone stale: at 13 of 273 matched SNPs it reported a homozygous `C*07:01`/`C*07:01`, where the same data and model at 271 of 273 gave the correct `C*01:02`/`C*07:01`.

`--hibag_min_matched_snps` (default `0.5`) therefore fails the run when fewer than that fraction of a locus's model SNPs are found, with the same diagnostic table as the zero-overlap error. The per-locus matched fraction is logged for every run and recorded in `<array_sample_id>.hibag_posterior.tsv` as `n_model_snps` / `n_matched_snps`.

Set it to `0` to disable the check, only if you accept unreliable calls.

### Getting a multi-locus model

The model bundled with the HIBAG R package covers **HLA-A only**, so a run using it reports one locus. For the test data, `testdata-make/11-download-hibag-model` fetches a published model covering A, B, C, DRB1, DQA1, DQB1 and DPB1:

```bash
testdata-make/11-download-hibag-model
```

These are the "HLARES" parameter estimates of Zheng et al. (2014), built from SNP markers common to the Illumina 1M Duo, OmniQuad, OmniExpress, 660K and 550K platforms. Four ancestries are published (`HIBAG_ANCESTRY`: European, Asian, Hispanic, African) in hg18 and hg19 (`HIBAG_MODEL_ASSEMBLY`); European/hg19 is the default and is the right one for NA12878.

They carry accurate hg19 positions but 2012-era rsIDs, many of which have since been merged or retired, so they need `--hibag_match_type Pos+Allele` — rsID matching finds only a few percent of each model's SNPs. `pipeline_testdata_run.sh` sets this for you.

### HIBAG dependency

`HIBAG_PREDICT` follows the standard nf-core pattern: its dependency is declared once in [`modules/local/hibag/predict/environment.yml`](../modules/local/hibag/predict/environment.yml) (`bioconda::bioconductor-hibag=1.42.0`), which feeds both the module's `conda` directive and a matching pinned Biocontainers/Galaxy-depot `container` directive. Run the SNP-array path with one of `-profile conda`, `-profile docker`, `-profile singularity` or `-profile apptainer` and Nextflow provisions HIBAG for you.

The package is deliberately **not** listed in [`envs/nf-core.yml`](../envs/nf-core.yml), so nothing here depends on `HIBAG` being installed in the environment you launch Nextflow from. Running with none of those profiles fails at this step with an explicit message naming the profiles to use, rather than silently imputing with whatever version happens to be on the host.

The pin is 1.42.0 rather than the newer 1.46.0 because 1.42.0 is the most recent release for which the Galaxy depot publishes a Singularity image, so a single version covers all four profiles.

### Preparing SNP-array test data

`testdata-make/10-prepare-na12878-array-hibag` downloads the NA12878 / GM12878 Illumina HumanOmniExpress-24 v1.0 array data from GEO and converts it to the PLINK genotypes this step consumes. See [`testdata-make/README.md`](../testdata-make/README.md) for what the conversion does and its limitations.

## RNA/WGS sample key input

`--sample_key` is a required top-level parameter whenever `--rna_samples` is provided. It maps RNA samples to their matched WGS sample (when one exists) for HLA consensus calling:

```bash
--sample_key '[path to sample key file]'
```

The sample key must be a comma-separated file with exactly these columns:

```csv title="sample_key.csv"
rnaseq_sample_id,wgs_sample_id
RNA_SAMPLE_1,WGS_SAMPLE_1
```

| Column             | Description                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rnaseq_sample_id` | RNA sample identifier; must match a `rna_id` from `--rna_samples`.        |
| `wgs_sample_id`    | WGS sample identifier; must match a `WGS_sample_id` from `--wgs_samples`. |

One row per RNA sample that has a matched WGS sample. An RNA sample simply absent from this file (or, when `--wgs_samples` is not provided at all, every RNA sample) is treated as having no WGS pairing: it is reported under a synthetic `RNA_ONLY:<rna_id>` group instead of being matched to a WGS sample. A `--sample_key` file with zero data rows is valid and simply routes every RNA sample through the `RNA_ONLY:<rna_id>` fallback.

`HLA_CONSENSUS` runs automatically whenever `--rna_samples` (and therefore `--sample_key`) are provided; there is no separate flag to enable it. `--wgs_samples` is optional and only affects whether WGS-derived alleles are available to blend into the consensus call for matched individuals - it does not affect whether `HLA_CONSENSUS` (or the downstream HLApm/STAR steps) run at all. When `--wgs_samples` is not provided, `HLA_CONSENSUS` combines the arcasHLA RNA genotype calls with an empty HLA-LA input, so every group falls back to `RNA_ONLY:<rna_id>` and the consensus call is RNA-only.

Two further optional parameters let you drop specific samples from consensus calling without editing the RNA/WGS/HLA-LA inputs themselves:

- `--rna_excluded_samples`: path to a plain-text file listing RNA sample IDs (one per line) to exclude.
- `--wgs_excluded_samples`: path to a plain-text file listing WGS sample IDs (one per line) to exclude.

`--hla_consensus_truncate_fields` (default `2`) controls how many colon-separated fields of each HLA allele are kept when comparing RNA and WGS calls (e.g. `02:07:01` truncated to 2 fields becomes `02:07`).

## HLApm personalized HLA reference

`HLAPM` runs automatically whenever `HLA_CONSENSUS` runs, i.e. whenever `--rna_samples` (and therefore `--sample_key`) are provided, regardless of whether `--wgs_samples` is also provided; there is no separate flag to enable it. It converts the `hla_consensus.rna_wgs_hla_consensus.tsv` consensus calls into one per-individual HLA allele-list TSV, then builds a personalized FASTA+GTF reference per allele, per individual, using [HLApm](https://github.com/davenportlab/HLApm)'s `bulkRNA_build_personalized_HLA_ref()` function. It does not run HLApm's own downstream STAR-index/mapping/allele-assignment stages, and single-cell mode is out of scope; instead, the pipeline runs its own STAR indexing step immediately afterwards (see below).

`--hlapm_allowed_loci` (default `A,B,C,DRB1,DQA1,DQB1,DPA1,DPB1,DOA,DOB,G,E,F`) is a comma-separated allow-list of HLA loci (without the `HLA-` prefix) to include when building the HLApm input. `HLA_CONSENSUS` output loci not in this list (e.g. `HLA-DRB3`, `HLA-H`, `HLA-J`, `HLA-K`, `HLA-L`) are silently omitted from the per-individual HLApm input TSVs; no separate audit/log file is written for excluded loci. This default is restricted to the loci HLApm's own per-allele locus regex can reliably parse — passing other loci through can crash the underlying R script.

### HLApm container

`HLAPM_BUILD_REF` follows the standard nf-core pattern for its R dependencies: they are declared once in [`modules/local/hlapm/build_ref/environment.yml`](../modules/local/hlapm/build_ref/environment.yml) (`r-base`, `data.table`, `dplyr`, `stringr`, `seqinr`, `Biostrings`, `rtracklayer`, `DECIPHER`, `bedtools`), which feeds both the module's `conda` directive and the image its `container` directive points at. The previously required operator-prepared `hlapm` Conda environment is gone; nothing needs to be created by hand for the R side.

HLApm itself is different. It is an unpackaged lab git repository rather than a Conda package, so it cannot be installed from `environment.yml` and reaches the module one of two ways:

- **Container profiles** (`-profile docker`/`singularity`/`apptainer`) — the image bakes in HLApm at pinned commit `38faa6087bbd827ccab969d947f8df101e95d688`, including its bundled `data/references/` files. Build it once before running:

  ```bash
  scripts/build_image_hlapm.sh
  ```

  This builds and tags the Docker image as `quay.io/hlarnaseq/hlapm-build-ref:38faa60`, matching `nextflow.config`'s `docker.registry`/`singularity.registry = 'quay.io'` default so `-profile docker` finds it locally with no registry push needed, and converts that same image into a local `modules/local/hlapm/build_ref/hlapm-build-ref.sif` (when `singularity`/`apptainer` is available) for `-profile singularity`/`apptainer`, for the same reason described for arcasHLA above. The build needs network access to `github.com` (for the HLApm clone) and to the Conda channels. Override the baked-in HLApm version with `HLAPM_COMMIT=<sha>` — see `scripts/build_image_hlapm.sh --help`.

- **`-profile conda`, or no profile at all** — `--hlapm_repo` is **mandatory**, and the pipeline fails fast at launch with a clear error if it is missing or does not exist, rather than failing partway through the run:

  ```bash
  --hlapm_repo '[path to a local HLApm checkout]'
  ```

  It must point to a local, pre-cloned checkout of [davenportlab/HLApm](https://github.com/davenportlab/HLApm), including its bundled `data/references/` files. The pipeline never clones or fetches HLApm at runtime; the checkout must already exist at this path before the pipeline runs.

Under a container profile `--hlapm_repo` remains available but **optional**: passing it overrides the baked-in checkout with your own (e.g. a patched or newer HLApm) without rebuilding the image. The override is staged into the task as an input, so it is mounted into the container automatically — no manual bind-mount options are needed. Either way, `versions.yml` reports which HLApm commit was actually used: the pinned commit from the image, or the override checkout's `git rev-parse HEAD`.

### HLApm STAR index

Immediately after `HLAPM` builds the personalized FASTA+GTF references, the pipeline builds a STAR genome index for every allele reference that actually exists under `hlapm/personalized_ref/out/<individual_ID>/*.fa` - the set of alleles indexed is discovered by scanning that output tree directly, not from the HLApm input TSV or the consensus calls, since HLApm can emit reference files for alleles not listed in its own input. Before indexing, allele references are deduplicated by a content hash (sha256 of FASTA+GTF): the same allele often recurs across multiple individuals, and hashing content (rather than trusting the allele name) avoids ever silently merging two different sequences that happen to share a name. See [output docs](output.md#hlapm-star-index) for the resulting `hlapm/star_index/` and `hlapm/star_index_targets/` layout, including how to look up which shared index applies to a given individual/allele via `sample_alleles.csv`.

This step reuses the [nf-core/modules `STAR_GENOMEGENERATE`](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/modules/nf-core/star/genomegenerate) module unmodified, pinned to **STAR 2.7.11b** - the same version used by [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/) to build this pipeline's own RNA-seq test data. Unlike arcasHLA/HLA-LA/HLApm above, STAR is **not** expected to already be available in an operator-prepared Conda environment on `$PATH`: run the pipeline with a container profile so Nextflow resolves STAR from the module's pinned container instead:

```bash
-profile singularity
```

`docker` works the same way. As a fallback, `-profile conda` lets Nextflow auto-create an isolated Conda environment from the module's pinned `environment.yml` (`bioconda::star=2.7.11b`) at run time instead of using a container; this has not been verified as thoroughly on all systems, so `singularity`/`docker` is recommended. This is a deliberate, scoped exception to this pipeline's general early-stage policy of assuming all tools come from an already-active Conda environment - every other step in the pipeline is unaffected.

### HLApm STAR alignment

Immediately after the STAR indexes are built, the pipeline aligns each RNA sample's arcasHLA MHC-extracted reads (`ARCASHLA`'s `.mhc_1.fq.gz`/`.mhc_2.fq.gz`, not the full/raw RNA fastqs) against every one of that sample's personalized allele indexes. This produces one alignment job per `(RNA sample, allele)` pair: a sample with 3 personalized alleles gets 3 separate STAR alignments, each reusing the same read pair against a different single-allele index.

`sample_alleles.csv`'s `sample` column is keyed by `HLA_CONSENSUS`'s grouping id (the WGS individual ID for WGS-backed individuals, or a synthetic `RNA_ONLY:<rna_id>` token otherwise) - not directly by RNA sample id. Before alignment, the pipeline resolves this back to real RNA sample ids using `--sample_key`: a WGS individual matched to more than one RNA sample in `--sample_key` has its full allele set aligned separately against each of those RNA samples' own reads (broadcast, not collapsed to one). This resolved mapping is published as `hlapm/star_align/rna_sample_alleles.csv` - see [output docs](output.md#hlapm-star-alignment) for its columns and for the alignment output layout.

This step reuses the [nf-core/modules `STAR_ALIGN`](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/modules/nf-core/star/align) module unmodified, pinned to the same **STAR 2.7.11b** version used for indexing above, and continues the same container/Conda exception described there (`-profile singularity`/`docker`/`conda`).

### HLApm read quantification

Immediately after alignment, each per-`(RNA sample, allele)` coordinate-sorted BAM (`STAR_ALIGN`'s own output, above) is additionally queryname-sorted with [nf-core/modules `SAMTOOLS_SORT`](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/modules/nf-core/samtools/sort) (`samtools sort -n`); `STAR_ALIGN`'s coordinate-sorted BAM is unchanged and continues to be published as before. Once every distinct allele's GTF (from HLApm STAR index, above) has been concatenated into one cohort-wide `combined.gtf` (comment lines stripped), the pipeline runs the legacy, unmodified Python 2.7 `make_a_table_210804_allHLAgenes.py` script once per RNA sample, over that sample's full set of per-allele queryname-sorted BAMs plus the combined GTF. For each read, this script assigns it to a gene by minimum summed-mate edit distance across every candidate allele/gene it overlaps, producing `<rna_id>.edit_distance.tsv` (one row per read, with a `unique`/`best`/`ambiguous` confidence label) plus a `<rna_id>.stat.txt` run-statistics log. See [output docs](output.md#hlapm-read-quantification) for the resulting `hlapm/quantify/` layout.

Immediately after `make_a_table_210804_allHLAgenes.py` writes `<rna_id>.edit_distance.tsv`, the pipeline runs a new `HLAPM_SUMMARIZE_READCOUNTS` step over that same table, using a new `bin/summarize_hla_readcounts.R` script (adapted from `davenportlab/HLApm_farm_pipeline`'s summarization script). For each RNA sample, it keeps only non-`ambiguous` reads whose winning-gene edit distance is at or below `--hlapm_quantify_max_edit_distance` (default `16`, matching the source script's hardcoded threshold), then counts the surviving reads per gene, producing `<rna_id>.HLA_gene_summary.tsv` (columns: `gene_name`, `n_reads_mapping`). This closes the "stops at the per-read table" gap left open by the earlier iteration; it runs from the [shared data-tools container](#shared-data-tools-container) rather than alongside `make_a_table_210804_allHLAgenes.py`'s Python 2 environment (see below).

`--hlapm_quantify_max_edit_distance` (default `16`) is passed straight through to this step as the maximum summed-mate edit distance (NM) a read may have and still count toward its assigned gene's read count.

Per-allele-level read counts, a cross-sample combined gene-count table, and comparison against `featureCounts` ground truth remain out of scope for this iteration.

#### HLApm read-quantification container

`HLAPM_QUANTIFY_READS` provisions its own dependencies from
[`modules/local/hlapm/quantify_reads/environment.yml`](../modules/local/hlapm/quantify_reads/environment.yml),
which feeds both the module's `conda` directive and the image its `container` directive points at. The previously required operator-prepared `hlapm-quantify` Conda environment is gone; nothing needs to be created by hand.

`make_a_table_210804_allHLAgenes.py` is unmodified legacy code, so this environment is a deliberately frozen **Python 2.7.15** (the newest Python 2 conda-forge ships) plus:

- `pybam`, pinned by commit `846d98603905c57c31bf7b9abaf2eb8c89899e60` - it is a GitHub-only package with no releases, tags or PyPI presence, so a commit SHA is the only reproducible handle on a version;
- `intervaltree` 3.1.0. The script prefers `quicksect` and falls back to `intervaltree`; `quicksect` is deliberately **not** installed, so the script keeps taking the `intervaltree` branch that every result this pipeline has produced so far came from.

Python 2 has been end of life since 2020 and receives no security updates. Freezing it inside a container, rather than asking operators to maintain a Python 2 environment, is precisely the point of this image; porting the script to Python 3 is the real fix and is a separate, much larger piece of work.

Build the image once before running with a container profile:

```bash
scripts/build_image_hlapm_quantify.sh
```

This builds and tags the Docker image as `quay.io/hlarnaseq/hlapm-quantify-reads:py2.7.15`, matching `nextflow.config`'s `docker.registry`/`singularity.registry = 'quay.io'` default so `-profile docker` finds it locally with no registry push needed, and converts it into a local `modules/local/hlapm/quantify_reads/hlapm-quantify-reads.sif` for `-profile singularity`/`apptainer`. The build needs network access to the Conda channels, PyPI and `github.com`. Override the pinned pybam commit with `PYBAM_COMMIT=<sha>` - see `scripts/build_image_hlapm_quantify.sh --help`, and note that `-profile conda` reads the pin from `environment.yml`, so change both to keep those two paths in step.

Under `-profile conda` the same `environment.yml` is used, which means Conda needs PyPI and `github.com` access the first time it creates that environment - `pybam` and `intervaltree` are `pip:` entries, outside Conda's solver.

#### Shared data-tools container

Eleven modules do not wrap a bioinformatics tool at all - they run this repository's own small analysis scripts from `bin/`, or a few lines of inline shell:

| Module                          | Script                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `HLA_CONSENSUS`                 | `call_hla_consensus.py` (python3, pandas)                                |
| `HLAPM_PREPARE_INPUT`           | `consensus_to_hlapm.py` (python3)                                        |
| `ARCASHLA_COMBINE`              | `combine_arcashla_genotypes.R` (jsonlite, dplyr, tibble, stringr, purrr) |
| `HLAPM_SUMMARIZE_READCOUNTS`    | `summarize_hla_readcounts.R` (dplyr, tidyr)                              |
| `HLA_READCOUNT_RECONCILE_DIFF`  | `reconcile_hla_readcounts.py` (python3, pandas)                          |
| `COUNTS_COMMONREF_HLA_REFORMAT` | `reformat_rnaseq_featurecounts.py` (python3) + `samtools`                |
| `HLALA_COMBINE`                 | inline shell (bash, coreutils, awk)                                      |
| `HIBAG_COMBINE`                 | inline shell (bash, coreutils, awk)                                      |
| `HLAPM_COMBINE_GTF`             | inline shell (bash, coreutils, grep)                                     |
| `HLAPM_LIST_STAR_TARGETS`       | inline shell (bash, coreutils, findutils)                                |
| `HLAPM_RESOLVE_SAMPLE_ALLELES`  | inline shell (bash, coreutils)                                           |

All eleven share one environment, [`containers/datatools/environment.yml`](../containers/datatools/environment.yml), and one image built from it. Unlike every other environment file here it is not module-local, because eleven near-identical copies of an overlapping package list would drift apart; see [`containers/datatools/README.md`](../containers/datatools/README.md).

`COUNTS_COMMONREF_HLA_REFORMAT` is why that environment also carries `samtools` (pinned to **1.24**, the same version `ARCASHLA_EXTRACT` and the vendored `SAMTOOLS_SORT` use, so the pipeline never runs two samtools versions): it needs `samtools` and `python3` together, and no prebuilt public image pairs them. The five inline-shell modules add nothing to the environment - `bash`, coreutils, `awk`, `findutils` and `grep` come from the image's base OS under a container profile and from the host under `-profile conda` - but they point at it so they declare a reproducible environment rather than none at all.

Build it once before running with a container profile:

```bash
scripts/build_image_datatools.sh
```

This builds `quay.io/hlarnaseq/datatools:1.1` and the local `containers/datatools/datatools.sif`, following the same local-image pattern as the other images described above. Under `-profile conda`, Nextflow creates the one environment and all eleven modules share it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The image tag moved from `:1.0` to `:1.1` when `samtools` was added. If you built the image before that, **rebuild it** - a run under `-profile docker` will otherwise fail to find `quay.io/hlarnaseq/datatools:1.1` in the local image store, and `-profile singularity`/`apptainer` will silently use a stale `.sif` with no `samtools`.

Package versions are pinned to those the pipeline's existing published results were produced with, so containerizing these steps changes no output. Running any of these eleven modules with no `-profile conda`/`docker`/`singularity`/`apptainer` now fails fast with a message naming those profiles, instead of silently using whichever `python3`/`Rscript`/`samtools` happens to be on the host `PATH` - the same trade already made for `ARCASHLA_EXTRACT`, `HIBAG_PREDICT` and `HLAPM_BUILD_REF`.

## Whole-genome common-reference gene counts

Independent of `--sample_key`/HLApm, whenever `--rna_samples` is provided the pipeline also runs [nf-core/modules `SUBREAD_FEATURECOUNTS`](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/modules/nf-core/subread/featurecounts) once per RNA sample, directly against that sample's original, full whole-genome, coordinate-sorted BAM (`--rna_samples`'s `bam`/`bai` columns) - not the arcasHLA MHC-extracted reads or HLApm personalized references used above. This reproduces, in-pipeline, the "original count matrix" half of the legacy prototype's `featureCounts` step, producing a per-sample whole-genome gene-count table without depending on an externally supplied count matrix file.

`--gtf` is **mandatory** whenever `--rna_samples` is provided (mirroring the existing `--hlapm_repo` requirement above): the pipeline fails fast with a clear error if it is missing or does not exist.

```bash
--gtf '[path to a whole-genome reference GTF]'
```

`--rnaseq_strandedness` (default `reverse`) sets the RNA-seq library strandedness passed to featureCounts (`-s`); allowed values are `unstranded`, `forward`, or `reverse`. This is a single pipeline-wide value, not a per-sample `--rna_samples` column - a future cohort needing per-sample strandedness would require revisiting this as a samplesheet column.

This step reuses the `SUBREAD_FEATURECOUNTS` module unmodified, pinned to **Subread 2.1.1**. As with `STAR_GENOMEGENERATE`/`STAR_ALIGN` above, Subread/featureCounts is **not** expected to already be available in an operator-prepared Conda environment on `$PATH`: run the pipeline with a container profile so Nextflow resolves it from the module's pinned container instead:

```bash
-profile singularity
```

`docker` works the same way. As a fallback, `-profile conda` lets Nextflow auto-create an isolated Conda environment from the module's pinned `environment.yml` (`bioconda::subread=2.1.1`) at run time instead of using a container; this has not been verified as thoroughly on all systems, so `singularity`/`docker` is recommended. This is the same deliberate, scoped exception to this pipeline's general early-stage policy already described for STAR above.

See [output docs](output.md#whole-genome-common-reference-gene-counts) for the resulting `counts_commonref/` layout. Patching these whole-genome counts with `HLAPM_STAR_QUANTIFY`'s HLA-specific counts (the final splice of the "hijack original count matrix" step) remains explicitly out of scope for this iteration; the per-gene reconciliation diff feeding that future step is produced by [HLA read-count reconciliation diff table](#hla-read-count-reconciliation-diff-table), below.

## HLA-region per-read featureCounts reconciliation input

Independent of `--sample_key`/HLApm, whenever `--rna_samples` is provided the pipeline also produces a per-read gene-assignment table for the HLA-region-restricted subset of each RNA sample's original BAM - the second of three steps so far toward the "hijack original count matrix" roadmap item. Unlike [Whole-genome common-reference gene counts](#whole-genome-common-reference-gene-counts) above (which is independent of/parallel to `ARCASHLA`), this step runs _after_ `ARCASHLA`, because it reuses `ARCASHLA_EXTRACT`'s own intermediate HLA-region BAM (`arcashla/extracted/<rna_id>.mhc.namesort.bam`, see [output docs](output.md#arcashla-read-extraction-and-validation)) rather than extracting the HLA region a second time from scratch. No new region-extraction dependency is introduced by this step.

`SUBREAD_FEATURECOUNTS` (aliased `SUBREAD_FEATURECOUNTS_HLA`, a second invocation of the same vendored module used above) runs with `-R BAM` against that intermediate BAM and the same cohort-wide `--gtf` reference already used above - no separate HLA-only GTF is built or required. This module has been patched (`nf-core modules patch subread/featurecounts`) to additionally capture the `-R BAM` per-read reannotated BAM as a declared output (previously an unexposed side effect of `-R BAM`); the patch also fixes an unrelated, pre-existing version-reporting defect (see `CHANGELOG.md`). The reannotated BAM is then converted to plain text with `samtools view`, filtered to `Assigned`-status lines, and reformatted into a `read_name`, `direction`, `gene_name`, `edit_distance` TSV by a new `bin/reformat_rnaseq_featurecounts.py` script. Both steps run inside `COUNTS_COMMONREF_HLA_REFORMAT`, which provisions its own `samtools` and `python3` from the [shared data-tools container](#shared-data-tools-container) - they are no longer expected on the host `$PATH`. (`SUBREAD_FEATURECOUNTS_HLA` itself continues the same container/`-profile conda` exception as `SUBREAD_FEATURECOUNTS` above.)

See [output docs](output.md#hla-region-per-read-featurecounts-reconciliation-input) for the resulting `counts_commonref_hla/` layout. This step itself stops at producing the per-read table; reconciling it against `HLAPM_STAR_QUANTIFY`'s HLA-specific `edit_distance.tsv` is described immediately below. The final splice into `counts_commonref`'s whole-genome table (the "hijack" step itself) remains out of scope for this iteration.

## HLA read-count reconciliation diff table

Whenever an RNA sample has both a `counts_commonref_hla` read-gene-assignment table (above) and a personalized-HLA `edit_distance.tsv` ([HLApm read quantification](#hlapm-read-quantification), above) - i.e. only samples resolved through `--sample_key`/HLApm to at least one personalized allele - the pipeline reconciles the two into a per-gene diff table, via a new `HLA_READCOUNT_RECONCILE` subworkflow (`HLA_READCOUNT_RECONCILE_DIFF` module) and a new `bin/reconcile_hla_readcounts.py` script. This is iteration 3 of the "hijack original count matrix" roadmap item: it adapts `artifacts/scripts/compare-hla-rnaseq-readcounts.py`'s read-pair reconciliation logic (kept-vs-dropped classification) to these two real pipeline tables. Samples not resolved to any personalized-HLA allele simply get no diff table - an expected inner-join outcome, not an error.

For every personalized-HLA read pair (after the existing `ambiguous`/`--hlapm_quantify_max_edit_distance` filtering, reusing the same threshold `HLAPM_SUMMARIZE_READCOUNTS` above uses), it is kept as HLA if the local `counts_commonref_hla` table has no matching read pair (`missing_fc`), if `counts_commonref_hla` also assigned it to an HLA gene (`both_hla`), or if `counts_commonref_hla` assigned it to a non-HLA gene but the personalized-reference edit distance is equal to or better (`reassigned_to_hla`); otherwise it is dropped in favor of the better non-HLA `counts_commonref_hla` assignment. Every post-filter personalized-HLA gene gets a row in the output - including a gene whose every read pair was dropped, with a reconciled count of `0` rather than a silently missing row (a gap fixed relative to the prototype script). A non-HLA gene only gets a row when it lost at least one read pair to HLA.

Every gene name in the output (HLA and non-HLA alike) is resolved to a `gene_id` via the whole-genome `--gtf` (unlike the separate `artifacts/scripts/hijack-original-featurecounts.py` prototype's own gene-mapping helper, which only resolves `HLA-`-prefixed names). Gene-id resolution never fails the run; instead it applies a soft, category-aware policy and records every problem in a dedicated, always-produced `<rna_id>.gene_id_resolution_warnings.tsv` file (see [output docs](output.md#hla-read-count-reconciliation-diff-table) for its full column schema), in addition to a batched stderr summary:

- A `gene_name` absent from `--gtf` resolves to the literal string `NA` - a personalized-reference-only or renamed gene symbol legitimately missing from the whole-genome GTF is plausible.
- A `gene_name` that maps to more than one distinct `gene_id` in `--gtf` (a real, non-hypothetical occurrence: GENCODE v50's primary assembly has 484 such ambiguous names, including 4 HLA genes themselves - `HLA-H`, `HLA-L`, `HLA-V`, `HLA-DRB6` - each a near-identical/overlapping-gene-row annotation-duplication artifact) is resolved deterministically instead of failing the run: an HLA-category row uses the first `gene_id` encountered while scanning `--gtf` (first-appearance order, not resolved alphabetically or by iteration order of a Python `set`); a non-HLA-category row instead keeps **every** candidate `gene_id`, semicolon-joined in that same first-appearance order (e.g. `ENSG00000236397.3;ENSG00000308415.1;ENSG00000310539.1`), so no candidate id is silently dropped.

This reconciliation - and the ambiguous-`gene_id` resolution above - operates entirely at `gene_name` granularity, never `gene_id`: the per-read `gene_id` featureCounts originally assigned (via its `XT` tag) is already discarded upstream, when [`bin/reformat_rnaseq_featurecounts.py`](#hla-region-per-read-featurecounts-reconciliation-input) converts it to `gene_name` (above) - `counts_commonref_hla`'s own per-read table never carries `gene_id` at all, so this step has no per-read `gene_id` left to work with even for a non-HLA row. This is not just an incidental data-loss inconvenience: featureCounts assigns each mate of a read pair independently, based on that mate's own overlap, so for two overlapping gene annotations that happen to share one `gene_name` (exactly the kind of annotation-duplication artifact described above - `POLR1HASP`'s two `gene_id`s are one real example: a large lncRNA locus with a smaller pseudogene entirely nested inside its span), a read pair's R1 and R2 mates can each be assigned a _different_ specific `gene_id` by featureCounts while still agreeing on `gene_name`. There is therefore no single, unambiguous `gene_id` to attribute a whole read pair to even in principle, which is why a non-HLA row's `original_fc_count`/`diff` (or an HLA row's `personalized_count`, which HLApm never associates with any whole-genome `gene_id` at all) is never split out per individual `gene_id` - the semicolon-joined-list/first-id policy above is the full extent of this step's `gene_id` resolution.

See [output docs](output.md#hla-read-count-reconciliation-diff-table) for the resulting `hla_readcount_reconcile/` layout and full column schema. This step produces only the per-sample diff table; merging/patching `counts_commonref`'s whole-genome table using this diff table (the final "hijack" splice) remains a future iteration.

## Running the pipeline

The typical command for running the pipeline is as follows:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/hlarnaseq \
    --rna_samples ./rna_samples.csv \
    --hla_region chr6:28500000-33400000 \
    --outdir ./results
```

MHC extraction (samtools), read-pair validation, and arcasHLA genotyping each provision their own tools: every one of those steps declares its own `environment.yml`/`conda` directive and a matching pinned `container`, resolved automatically by Nextflow under `-profile conda`/`docker`/`singularity`/`apptainer`. In particular, samtools no longer has to be installed by hand in the active Conda environment; running with none of those profiles fails with an explicit message naming the missing tool.

As of this iteration this is true of **every** local module: all seventeen processes under `modules/local/` declare a `conda` directive backed by an `environment.yml` and a matching pinned `container`, as do all vendored `modules/nf-core/` modules. No pipeline step now falls back to whatever happens to be on the host `$PATH`. An operator-prepared Conda environment is still needed to _launch_ the pipeline (`nextflow`, `nf-core`, `nf-test`), but no longer to run any of its steps.

> [!NOTE]
> `-profile test`'s bundled RNA fixture is deliberately tiny and does not carry real HLA allele signal, so arcasHLA genotypes it as empty. Since `HLA_CONSENSUS`, `HLAPM`, and STAR indexing/alignment are now mandatory whenever `--rna_samples`/`--sample_key` are provided, a real (non-stub) `-profile test` run will fail once it reaches `HLA_CONSENSUS`/`HLAPM` with no allele calls to consense. At this development stage, `-profile test` is validated with `-stub-run` (`nextflow run . -profile test -stub-run --outdir <OUTDIR>`), which proves process/channel wiring without needing real tool output. A real, non-stub `-profile test` run is not expected to succeed yet.

Note that the pipeline will create the following files in your working directory:

```bash
work                # Directory containing the nextflow working files
<OUTDIR>            # Finished results in specified location (defined with --outdir)
.nextflow_log       # Log file from Nextflow
# Other nextflow hidden files, eg. history of pipeline runs and old logs.
```

If you wish to repeatedly use the same parameters for multiple runs, rather than specifying each flag in the command, you can specify these in a params file.

Pipeline settings can be provided in a `yaml` or `json` file via `-params-file <file>`.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use `-c <file>` to specify parameters as this will result in errors. Custom config files specified with `-c` must only be used for [tuning process resource specifications](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#tuning-workflow-resources), other infrastructural tweaks (such as output directories), or module arguments (args).

The above pipeline run specified with a params file in yaml format:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/hlarnaseq -profile docker -params-file params.yaml
```

with:

```yaml title="params.yaml"
rna_samples: './rna_samples.csv'
hla_region: 'chr6:28500000-33400000'
outdir: './results/'
genome: 'GRCh38'
<...>
```

You can also generate such `YAML`/`JSON` files via [nf-core/launch](https://nf-co.re/launch).

### Updating the pipeline

When you run the above command, Nextflow automatically pulls the pipeline code from GitHub and stores it as a cached version. When running the pipeline after this, it will always use the cached version if available - even if the pipeline has been updated since. To make sure that you're running the latest version of the pipeline, make sure that you regularly update the cached version of the pipeline:

```bash
nextflow pull nf-core/hlarnaseq
```

### Reproducibility

It is a good idea to specify the pipeline version when running the pipeline on your data. This ensures that a specific version of the pipeline code and software are used when you run your pipeline. If you keep using the same tag, you'll be running the same version of the pipeline, even if there have been changes to the code since.

First, go to the [nf-core/hlarnaseq releases page](https://github.com/nf-core/hlarnaseq/releases) and find the latest pipeline version - numeric only (eg. `1.3.1`). Then specify this when running the pipeline with `-r` (one hyphen) - eg. `-r 1.3.1`. Of course, you can switch to another version by changing the number after the `-r` flag.

This version number will be logged in reports when you run the pipeline, so that you'll know what you used when you look back in the future.

To further assist in reproducibility, you can use share and reuse [parameter files](#running-the-pipeline) to repeat pipeline runs with the same settings without having to write out a command with every single parameter.

> [!TIP]
> If you wish to share such profile (such as upload as supplementary material for academic publications), make sure to NOT include cluster specific paths to files, nor institutional specific profiles.

## Core Nextflow arguments

> [!NOTE]
> These options are part of Nextflow and use a _single_ hyphen (pipeline parameters use a double-hyphen)

### `-profile`

Use this parameter to choose a configuration profile. Profiles can give configuration presets for different compute environments.

Several generic profiles are bundled with the pipeline which instruct the pipeline to use software packaged using different methods (Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, Apptainer, Conda) - see below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We highly recommend the use of Docker or Singularity containers for full pipeline reproducibility, however when this is not possible, Conda is also supported.

The pipeline also dynamically loads configurations from [https://github.com/nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs) when it runs, making multiple config profiles for various institutional clusters available at run time. For more information and to check if your system is supported, please see the [nf-core/configs documentation](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation).

Note that multiple profiles can be loaded, for example: `-profile test,docker` - the order of arguments is important!
They are loaded in sequence, so later profiles can overwrite earlier profiles.

If `-profile` is not specified, the pipeline will run locally and expect all software to be installed and available on the `PATH`. This is _not_ recommended, since it can lead to different results on different machines dependent on the computer environment.

- `test`
  - A profile with a complete configuration for automated testing
  - Includes links to test data so needs no other parameters
- `docker`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Docker](https://docker.com/)
- `singularity`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/)
- `podman`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- `shifter`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Shifter](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/)
- `charliecloud`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Charliecloud](https://charliecloud.io/)
- `apptainer`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/)
- `wave`
  - A generic configuration profile to enable [Wave](https://seqera.io/wave/) containers. Use together with one of the above (requires Nextflow ` 24.03.0-edge` or later).
- `conda`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/). Please only use Conda as a last resort i.e. when it's not possible to run the pipeline with Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, or Apptainer.

### `-resume`

Specify this when restarting a pipeline. Nextflow will use cached results from any pipeline steps where the inputs are the same, continuing from where it got to previously. For input to be considered the same, not only the names must be identical but the files' contents as well. For more info about this parameter, see [this blog post](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2019/demystifying-nextflow-resume.html).

You can also supply a run name to resume a specific run: `-resume [run-name]`. Use the `nextflow log` command to show previous run names.

### `-c`

Specify the path to a specific config file (this is a core Nextflow command). See the [nf-core website documentation](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration) for more information.

## Custom configuration

### Resource requests

Whilst the default requirements set within the pipeline will hopefully work for most people and with most input data, you may find that you want to customise the compute resources that the pipeline requests. Each step in the pipeline has a default set of requirements for number of CPUs, memory and time. For most of the pipeline steps, if the job exits with any of the error codes specified [here](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/4c27ef5610c87db00c3c5a3eed10b1d161abf575/conf/base.config#L18) it will automatically be resubmitted with higher resources request (2 x original, then 3 x original). If it still fails after the third attempt then the pipeline execution is stopped.

To change the resource requests, please see the [max resources](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#max-resources) and [tuning workflow resources](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#tuning-workflow-resources) section of the nf-core website.

### Custom Containers

In some cases, you may wish to change the container or conda environment used by a pipeline steps for a particular tool. By default, nf-core pipelines use containers and software from the [biocontainers](https://biocontainers.pro/) or [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) projects. However, in some cases the pipeline specified version maybe out of date.

To use a different container from the default container or conda environment specified in a pipeline, please see the [updating tool versions](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#updating-tool-versions) section of the nf-core website.

### Custom Tool Arguments

A pipeline might not always support every possible argument or option of a particular tool used in pipeline. Fortunately, nf-core pipelines provide some freedom to users to insert additional parameters that the pipeline does not include by default.

To learn how to provide additional arguments to a particular tool of the pipeline, please see the [customising tool arguments](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/configuration#customising-tool-arguments) section of the nf-core website.

### nf-core/configs

In most cases, you will only need to create a custom config as a one-off but if you and others within your organisation are likely to be running nf-core pipelines regularly and need to use the same settings regularly it may be a good idea to request that your custom config file is uploaded to the `nf-core/configs` git repository. Before you do this please can you test that the config file works with your pipeline of choice using the `-c` parameter. You can then create a pull request to the `nf-core/configs` repository with the addition of your config file, associated documentation file (see examples in [`nf-core/configs/docs`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/tree/master/docs)), and amending [`nfcore_custom.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/blob/master/nfcore_custom.config) to include your custom profile.

See the main [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html) for more information about creating your own configuration files.

If you have any questions or issues please send us a message on [Slack](https://nf-co.re/join/slack) on the [`#configs` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/configs).

## Running in the background

Nextflow handles job submissions and supervises the running jobs. The Nextflow process must run until the pipeline is finished.

The Nextflow `-bg` flag launches Nextflow in the background, detached from your terminal so that the workflow does not stop if you log out of your session. The logs are saved to a file.

Alternatively, you can use `screen` / `tmux` or similar tool to create a detached session which you can log back into at a later time.
Some HPC setups also allow you to run nextflow within a cluster job submitted your job scheduler (from where it submits more jobs).

## Nextflow memory requirements

In some cases, the Nextflow Java virtual machines can start to request a large amount of memory.
We recommend adding the following line to your environment to limit this (typically in `~/.bashrc` or `~./bash_profile`):

```bash
NXF_OPTS='-Xms1g -Xmx4g'
```
