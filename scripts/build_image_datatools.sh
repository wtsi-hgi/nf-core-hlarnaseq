Usage:
  scripts/build_image_datatools.sh

Builds the shared python3 + R data-tools image locally, so the `container`
directive of every module that runs one of this pipeline's own bin/ analysis
scripts - or one of its small inline-shell data-shuffling steps - resolves with
no registry push required:

  HLA_CONSENSUS, HLAPM_PREPARE_INPUT, ARCASHLA_COMBINE, HLAPM_SUMMARIZE_READCOUNTS,
  HLA_READCOUNT_RECONCILE_DIFF, COUNTS_COMMONREF_HLA_REFORMAT, HLALA_COMBINE,
  HIBAG_COMBINE, HLAPM_COMBINE_GTF, HLAPM_LIST_STAR_TARGETS,
  HLAPM_RESOLVE_SAMPLE_ALLELES

  - Docker: builds and tags the image as IMAGE_TAG (default
    quay.io/hlarnaseq/datatools:1.1 - matching nextflow.config's
    docker.registry, so Docker finds it locally under -profile docker without
    ever attempting a network pull).
  - Singularity/Apptainer: if `singularity` or `apptainer` is also available,
    additionally converts that same local Docker image straight from the
    Docker daemon (docker-daemon://) into a .sif file at SIF_PATH (default
    containers/datatools/datatools.sif), which those modules reference by
    path - Singularity has no access to Docker's local image store, and a bare
    image name is not a filesystem path, so without this .sif Nextflow would
    try (and fail) to pull from quay.io over the network.

Unlike the other build_image_*.sh scripts here, this image is shared rather
than module-local; see containers/datatools/README.md. If you change
containers/datatools/environment.yml, bump IMAGE_TAG below AND the `container`
directive in all eleven modules above so a tag always means one set of contents.

Environment:
  IMAGE_TAG   Docker image reference to build/tag. Default: quay.io/hlarnaseq/datatools:1.1
  SIF_PATH    Output path for the converted Singularity image. Default: containers/datatools/datatools.sif
