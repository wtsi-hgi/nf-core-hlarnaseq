# This script FETCHES AND INDEXES A PUBLISHED PRG graph. It downloads the
# prebuilt PRG data package, verifies it, extracts it, and indexes it twice
# over:
#
#   1. `HLA-LA --action prepareGraph`, producing `serializedGRAPH` - exactly,
#      and only, what nf-core's `hlala/preparegraph` module does; and
#   2. `bwa index` over `extendedReferenceGenome/extendedReferenceGenome.fa`.
#
# Step 2 is not part of `prepareGraph`, and the published tarball does not ship
# it: `mapping_PRGonly/referenceGenome.fa` arrives pre-indexed but
# `extendedReferenceGenome/` contains the FASTA alone. HLA-LA therefore builds
# that index lazily, at typing time - see the comment on step 7 for why leaving
# it to do that breaks multi-sample runs. Both indexes together are what the
# pipeline needs.
#
# CONSTRUCTING a PRG graph from scratch (for a newer IMGT/HLA release, or for
# custom loci) is NOT the aim of the script.

Usage:
  scripts/build_reference_hlala.sh <output-dir>

Fetches a published HLA-LA PRG graph package into <output-dir> and indexes it,
by running `HLA-LA --action prepareGraph` and then `bwa index` over the graph's
extended reference genome, inside the SAME pinned container image the
HLALA_TYPING module itself runs (hla-la 1.0.4) - so the graph is indexed by the
exact build that will later consume it, with no separate Conda environment to
set up. That image already contains the bwa the second step needs (bwa 0.7.12
is a dependency of the hla-la Conda package), so it needs no extra tooling.

Both indexes matter. HLA-LA builds the bwa index itself, lazily, the first time
it maps reads against the extended reference genome - writing it INTO the graph
directory. Since the pipeline shares one graph directory across every WGS
sample, all concurrent HLALA_TYPING tasks would start that same `bwa index` at
once and clobber each other's output, so all but (at most) one sample fails.
Building it here, once, out of band, removes the race.

Unlike arcasHLA's reference, this image is public (Biocontainers/Galaxy
depot), so there is no companion build_image_*.sh script: the container is
pulled on first use.

This script does NOT construct a graph from scratch - it downloads and indexes
a graph the HLA-LA authors published. Building a PRG graph from a newer
IMGT/HLA release is not scriptable outside the tool author's own environment
(see the comment block at the top of this file for the details). If you need a
newer graph, ask upstream.

What to expect before you start it:
  * ~2.25 GB download, and about 29 GB on disk once extracted and fully
    indexed (serializedGRAPH alone is ~5.5 GB, and the bwa index over the
    3 GB extended reference genome adds ~5.1 GB more). The free-space
    pre-flight below refuses up front rather than failing hours in.
  * prepareGraph takes a few hours and, per HLA-LA's own README, "might take
    up to 40G of memory"; `bwa index` over a 3 GB FASTA adds roughly another
    hour but is not memory-hungry. This is a one-off, out-of-band operation.

Point the pipeline at the result with (both values are printed on success):
  --hlala_graph_dir <output-dir> --hlala_graph <GRAPH_NAME>

Re-running is free: if the graph is already fully indexed, the script says so
and exits without downloading, extracting or indexing anything - it checks that
BEFORE the download, so pointing it at a finished graph costs nothing. Each
indexing step is skipped independently when its own output is already there, so
a graph built by an earlier version of this script (serializedGRAPH present,
bwa index missing) is repaired by just re-running the script on the same
directory: it adds the missing bwa index and neither re-downloads nor
re-serializes. To force a full rebuild, delete the graph directory
(<output-dir>/<GRAPH_NAME>) and re-run. That is deliberately the only way to do
it; there is no FORCE_* override (see the comment where the check is
implemented).

Environment:
  GRAPH_NAME    Graph directory name inside <output-dir>, and the value to pass
                to --hlala_graph. Default: PRG_MHC_GRCh38_withIMGT
  GRAPH_URL     Source tarball URL.
                Default: https://www.chg.ox.ac.uk/downloads/PRG_MHC_GRCh38_withIMGT.tar.gz
  GRAPH_MD5     Expected md5 of the tarball; `-` skips the check (not advised).
                Default: 525a8aa0c7f357bf29fe2c75ef1d477d
  TARBALL       Path to an already-downloaded tarball to use instead of
                fetching one (e.g. an offline/shared copy). Default: unset
  IMAGE_TAG     Docker image to run.
                Default: quay.io/biocontainers/hla-la:1.0.4--h077b44d_1
  SIF_PATH      Singularity/Apptainer image (local .sif path, or a URL to pull)
                used when Docker is unavailable.
                Default: https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/hla-la:1.0.4--h077b44d_1
  REQUIRED_GB   Free-space floor, in GB, on <output-dir>'s filesystem.
                Default: 35

GRAPH_NAME/GRAPH_URL/GRAPH_MD5 exist so this script also works for the other
graph packages HLA-LA publishes, and so a future move of the download host
does not require editing it. They do not imply that new graphs can be
constructed.

# 7. bwa-index the extended reference genome.
#
#    WHY THIS STEP EXISTS. `prepareGraph` does not build this index, and the
#    published tarball does not ship it: mapping_PRGonly/referenceGenome.fa
#    arrives with its .amb/.ann/.bwt/.pac/.sa, but extendedReferenceGenome/
#    contains the FASTA alone. HLA-LA copes by indexing it lazily - in the
#    `--action HLA` path, BWAmapper::map() calls make_sure_ref_is_indexed(),
#    which shells out to `bwa index` (src/mapper/bwa/BWAmapper.cpp) - and
#    writes the result NEXT TO THE FASTA, i.e. back into the graph directory.
#
#    That is fine for one sample at a time and broken for a pipeline. The graph
#    is a single shared, read-mostly input: HLALA_TYPING receives it as a
#    `path` input, so every per-sample task sees the same underlying directory.
#    Run N WGS samples and all N tasks find the index missing, all N launch
#    `bwa index` against the same paths, and they overwrite each other's
#    half-written output - so all but (at most) one sample fails, hours in, for
#    a reason that looks nothing like its cause.
#
#    Building it once here removes the race outright, and is why
#    hlalaGraphDirExistsError() in
#    subworkflows/local/utils_nfcore_hlarnaseq_pipeline/main.nf now refuses to
#    start a --wgs_samples run against a graph that lacks it.
#
#    `bwa index` takes no thread or memory options - there is nothing to size
#    to the host here, unlike prepareGraph.
